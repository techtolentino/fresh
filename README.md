FRESH( );
=========

Welcome to the Fresh Function App

Fresh( ); is a simple FEWD project which allows users to input several options from select dropdown menus. Upon clicking the "Create That" button, new images pop up onto the t-shirt, thus, creating a unique code-related t-shirt!

> While many organizations and start-up companies have their own branding strategies, the truth is, you can never have enough dev-swag. Mindful of the void, I set out to create a simple model: let the user design their own code gear. In all honesty, I think the designs come out a lot cleaner than I expected/hoped for... however, it's still a pretty fun app.
